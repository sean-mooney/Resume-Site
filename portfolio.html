              Using MEAN, I reverse engineered reddit.com to demonstrate my abilities with the stack as well as expand
              my knowledge and learn new techniques. To achieve this, I created a RESTful API for CRUD functions,
              utilized MongoDB to store posts and user information,
              and adhered to the MVC design pattern with Angular to achieve a functional front end.

              My personal website written in HTML, CSS on Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Reflecting on my past portfolio
              website, I realized
              I had improved a lot since its completetion and felt it didn't accurately represent my skills anymore. I
              wanted to implement new ideas and techniques
              I had picked up from working on other projects into a website that better reflected my abilities.

              Created using Unity 3D, C#, Blender, and Photoshop, this personal project stemmed from my love of the

              During the time I spent making it, I learned how to implement anti-cheat practices, how to provide a
              concurrent game across a network,
              and calculate AI trajectories for objects to travel along to avoid obstacles.

              This website was a project I completed for my father who is a Construction Project Manager. Using
              SquareSpace, I created a platform for him to post new homes he's building,
              upload his portfolio to showcase his work, and have others contact him if they're interested. While
              SquareSpace provides an easier way to
              make websites, it has many limitations that require workarounds to perfect the product. One example is
              there is no feature for a portfolio to be on
              more than one page. To get around this, I hardcoded two buttons, a list of numbers, and wrote a script to
              determine what the next page should be based on the
              current page being viewed, and highlight the current page's number. It was a good demonstration of
              hacking around the limitations of a software and working around them
              to achieve a better result.

              Xavier was created during my time at Independent Software's A100 Program.
              My team and I, consisting of 5 people including me, worked in an Agile environment and set out to make a
              working prototype for a partner company's web app idea.
              We completed the project in a timespan of 2 months using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Meteor, Mongo, and
              Bootstrap. Due to a NDA, I can't describe the website in much detail, however,
              it was my first experience working within a team to build a piece of software that would be used by other
              people. I learned alot from my time at A100
              and how to effectively work within a team.

              Another project from my time with A100, this website was meant to demonstrate what I already knew about
              web development.
              I used HTML/CSS, Javascript/jQuery, and Bootstrap to produce the final version. This website was my first
              introduction to
              Bootstrap and was helpful to showcase what I already knew to people who worked in the industry. Since
              then I've learned
              a lot more about programming and front-end design which prompted the creation of this current website.

          <div class="project-desc col-12">
            <p>
              When I was attending Norwalk Community College, I signed up for a mobile development course. While I
              enjoyed the course, I found that
              it didn't go as in-depth as I wanted it to in each stack but instead focused more on all types of mobile
              app development. That being said,
              we had to pick a platform for our final project and I had found that I enjoyed programming with Android
              Studio more than the others.
              Using what I had learned from the course and previous programming knowledge,
              I worked on a remake of the classic carnival game, "Whack-a-Mole". It features pause and start
              functionality, score keeping, and a new game function. It was my first
              finished mobile application and I'm happy with the way it turned out (I scored 100 on my final with it).

              <p>
                Built for my Java 2 class at Norwalk Community College,
                I utilized advanced practices and techniques that made it almost impossible for stack overflow to help when I got stuck.
                The course had the highest drop rate of any in the school, we started the semester with around 20 students and dropped down to just 4 by the end.
                The app itself features a login page that queries an SQL server, has back door protection, converts a value based on a currency exchange rate retrieved from a server,
                retrieves the currencies available from the server and populates a drop down list with them, and much more. The whole project took all semester to complete,
                it was how we learned so much about Java, by building off an existing product. All of this was accomplished without anything being hardcoded, we would lose points if anything was.
